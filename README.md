questions
---------

##### Seriously, another merge tool?
Yep. Someday, there might be a rationale here. It might include things like
advances in diff/patch etc. It might talk about how some folks don't like to
leave the terminal for a bit o' ye olde merging. It might mention other
things. It might not.

##### Compare with other cli merge options?
Meh. They're all good. None of them is tim.

##### Is tim an acronym?
